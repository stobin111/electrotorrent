          <h1>What is ElectroTorrent?</h1>
          <p>ElectroTorrent is the UKâ€™s only online marketplace for renewable energy. The service gives consumers and generators direct access to each other, offering innovators a new model for buying and selling energy.</p>
          <p>For sustainable business, ElectroTorrent is a tool to make conscious and active decisions about where they source electricity from. For renewable energy generators, ElectroTorrent shows them their electricity market, and charts demand for their electricity at different price levels.</p>
          <h1>How does it work?</h1>
          <p>Renewable electricity generators set pricing and access preferences, while consumers set their electricity portfolio preferences through the online service, available on your computer, phone and tablet.</p>
          <p>ElectroTorrent takes in all the pricing and preferences information and matches electricity demand and supply every half hour - 48 times every day. Good Energy help ensure that the marketplace is always balanced, purchasing surplus power or providing 100% renewable top-up when required.</p>
