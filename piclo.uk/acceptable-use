<p>We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users from third parties when they use

moderate any interactive service we provide on our sites, and we expressly exclude our
liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in
contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.</p>

contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</p>

<p>You must comply with the spirit and the letter of the following standards. The standards
apply to each part of any contribution as well as to its whole.</p>
<p>Contributions must:</p>

<li>Comply with applicable law in the UK and in any country from which they are posted.</li>
