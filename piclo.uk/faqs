<h2 id="what-is-piclo"><strong>What is Piclo?</strong></h2>
<p>Piclo is an online renewable energy market. It lets people buy and sell renewable electricity directly.<br />
The system hands control back to the users. Generators will be able to choose who they’re selling to and at what price, while consumers will be able to buy specific types of renewable electricity from sources of their choice.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://d1o1wdbk5ytaqh.cloudfront.net/static/images/piclo-overview2.8570e0b638b2.png" /></p>
<p>This year’s 6 month trial is a collaboration between innovative energy startup, Open Utility, and 100% renewable electricity supplier, Good Energy. We share a common vision of a world powered by renewable energy helping combat climate change.</p>
<p>Piclo is the first step towards a truly open electricity system, and paves the way for a smarter, more dynamic and decentralised electricity market.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work"><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
<p>For the first time in the UK, generators and consumers can buy and sell electricity through Piclo, a service you can use on your computer, phone and tablet.</p>
<p>Renewable electricity generators log on and set their prices and consumer preferences to sell their exported renewable electricity. Consumers also log on and set their preferences for buying electricity, amending their electricity portfolio.</p>
<p>Piclo takes in all the pricing and preferences information and matches electricity demand and supply every half hour of the day. Good Energy help ensure that the marketplace is always balanced, purchasing surplus power or providing 100% renewable top-up when required.</p>
<p>Users get a full breakdown of their electricity usage, detailing where it came from and how much was used throughout the last day, week, month. The data gathered from half-hourly meters is analysed and sorted into usage graphs, available online at any time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://d1o1wdbk5ytaqh.cloudfront.net/static/images/piclo-how-it-works.119a42bebc8b.png" /></p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-renewable-energy-can-i-buy-and-where-will-it-come-from"><strong>What type of renewable energy can I buy, and where will it come from?</strong></h2>
<p>The Piclo marketplace can sell electricity from solar, wind and hydro generators, from sources across the UK.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://d1o1wdbk5ytaqh.cloudfront.net/static/images/piclo-power-types.1a80c0d1aca4.png" /></p>
<p><br></br></p>
<h2 id="where-is-piclo-being-trialled"><strong>Where is Piclo being trialled?</strong></h2>
<p>Piclo is being trialled across the UK. Unfortunately Northern Ireland can’t take part at the moment because it uses a different grid network. Anyone in England, Wales and Scotland can take part.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<h2 id="why-should-i-join-piclo"><strong>Why should I join Piclo?</strong></h2>
<p>It’s the chance to be part of the UK’s first online energy marketplace, and to take a step towards an open, democratic energy marketplace.</p>

<h2 id="how-long-does-piclo-last-for"><strong>How long does Piclo last for?</strong></h2>
<p>Piclo is a 6-month trial beginning in October. Over the trial, you’ll be able to forge relationships, buy/sell power with partners, save on peak grid charges and view how your site is performing.</p>
<p>Any customer can opt-out of Piclo once the trial ends in March. After opting out, the customer can continue on Good Energy’s standard service or switch to another supplier when their contract expires.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-piclo-finishes"><strong>What happens when Piclo finishes?</strong></h2>
<p>Piclo is a 6-month trial from October 2015 - March 2016. After this, Piclo hopes to launch as a commercial marketplace.</p>
<p>All trial users will have the chance to switch over into the commercial peer-to-peer energy marketplace (based on the trial marketplace). If a user doesn’t want to enter the commercial model, they can opt out of Piclo and either continue on Good Energy’s standard service or switch to another supplier when their contract expires.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<h2 id="will-i-save-money-on-my-energy-bills-or-will-i-make-more-from-my-generation"><strong>Will I save money on my energy bills, or will I make more from my generation?</strong></h2>
<p>Customers can enjoy discounted prices that generators set. Piclo offers the power for generators to discount their export electricity, and set preferences around who buys it. If the customer and generator preferences align, there is the potential for savings by purchasing discounted energy. The maximum discount allocation for generators is 25% of their PPA.</p>
<p>Piclo cannot guarantee that customers will save money, or that generators will make more money. However, the aim of the pilot is to explore ways to make savings in the energy system - by buying locally and avoiding some distribution and transmission charges. We’ll be publishing our findings in a final report to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC).</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<h2 id="will-my-energy-bills-change"><strong>Will my energy bills change?</strong></h2>
<p>You will receive modified energy bills for Piclo, based on the existing Good Energy billing services.</p>
<p>Customers will get the standard monthly billing information, along with a split out of your energy usage in the Red, Amber, Green (RAG) Distribution Charging periods and a summary of Piclo trading results. Generators will get a monthly invoice, also with a summary of Piclo trading results.</p>
<p>Every kWh traded can be traced through your Piclo account. For every half hour, you will be able to see how much you consumed or generated, where it came from or went to.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<h2 id="who-is-good-energy-and-open-utility"><strong>Who is Good Energy and Open Utility?</strong></h2>
<p>Open Utility is an innovative technology startup passionate about building a peer-to-peer renewable energy system. The small but ambitious team is based in London.</p>
<p>Good Energy is a fast-growing green energy company, generating and selling 100% renewable electricity to homes and businesses across the UK, all wrapped up in great customer service.</p>
<p><br></br></p>
<h2 id="who-can-sign-up-to-piclo"><strong>Who can sign up to Piclo?</strong></h2>
<p>We’re looking for commercial energy consumers and renewable energy generators to trial the peer-to-peer energy marketplace.</p>
<p>If you’re a commercial electricity consumer, the basic requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half Hourly metered (profile class 0)</li>
<li>Be willing to sign a Power Supply Agreement (PSA) with Good Energy</li>

<h2 id="im-not-with-good-energy-at-the-moment-can-i-still-sign-up-to-piclo"><strong>I’m not with Good Energy at the moment. Can I still sign up to Piclo?</strong></h2>
<p>You can still sign up to Piclo! However, to take part in the trial marketplace, you will need to sign up to a Good Energy power agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a half-hourly export metered commercial electricity consumer, you just need to sign a Power Supply Agreement with Good Energy</li>
<li>If you’re a half-hourly export metered renewable electricity generator, you will need to sign a Power Purchase Agreement with Good Energy</li>
</ul>
